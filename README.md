# Gravity

Binary code size profiler for WebAssembly built with [WasmTransformer](https://github.com/swiftwasm/WasmTransformer), [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), and [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/).

While it is not fully implemented yet, the goal of the app is to pinpoint biggest sections and functions in your binaries built with SwiftWasm. Star and watch for updates!
